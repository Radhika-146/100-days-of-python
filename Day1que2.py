'''Q2: Write a program to input two numbers and display their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
10 2
Output 1:
Sum=12, Diff=8, Product=20, Quotient=5

Input 2:
7 3
Output 2:
Sum=10, Diff=4, Product=21, Quotient=2'''

n1=int(input("enter a number:"))
n2=int(input("enter another numnber:"))
print("sum=",n1+n2," diff=",n1-n2," product=",n1*n2," quotient=",n1 // n2)
